#   greg's script didn't work. had to fix it. forget what i did tho =/

# if we're passed an argument
if [ "$1" ]; then
        # and the argument doesn't exist on the filesystem as a dir, socket, pipe or file
        if [ ! -x "$1" ]; then
                # touch it
                touch $1
                # add it to svn
                svn add $1
